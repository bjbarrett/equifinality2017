Simulation and Graphing Code for:

Barrett, BJ. 2018. Equifinality in empirical studies of cultural transmission. Behavioral Processes.

1) 'behav proc sim.r' contains simulation code for figure 1. It takes a while to run as it was originally set up to calculate predictions for individuals who vary and uses both individual and social learning. In this paper, I only look at cases of pure social learning or pure individual learning for simplicity and to make a pedagogical point. The reader may alter simulations so that both individual and social learning affect an individuals proability of choosing a behavior.

2) 'fig2acquisitioncurves.r' contains simulation code for the acquisition curves of frequency-dependece and payoff-bias in figures 2a and 2b.
